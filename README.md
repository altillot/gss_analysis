# gss_analysis
**Overview:** Using the General Social Survey, I run some regression analyses and create a visualization in R

**Description:** For practice purposes in a Data Analysis course, I perform a series of variable recodes for variables included in the General Social Survey. In addition to creating descriptive tables of the data (i.e. cross tabulations, descriptive statistics), I perform two simple bivariate regressions. Lastly, I create a bar plot visualization showing how preferences for traditional gender roles differs across age.

**Models & Techniques Used:**
- Simple bivariate regression
- Bar plot visualization

**Packages Used:**
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- plyr
- gmodels
- psych
